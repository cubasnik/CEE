## The physical network definitons will in case of OpenStack deployments be propagated to
## OpenStack configuration files (ml2_conf.ini, openvswitch_agent.ini) Physical networks
## must be configured for passthrough devices if such ones are supposed to be available
## in an OpenStack deployment.
## In case of NVIDIA(R) Network Interface Card (NIC) interfaces configured for passthrough,
## separate physical networks must be configured for interfaces aimed at Physical Function
## (PF) passthrough and interfaces aimed at Virtual Function (VF) passthrough respectively.
## Physical networks can also optionally be used for
## OVS interfaces (br-prv). If no physical network is explicitly configured for OVS, the
## default physical network is used.
## Available options are:
##  - name: The name of the physical network can contain alphanumeric characters,
##  underscores ("_"), and hyphens ("-"). This is the name that will be used by Neutron.
##  - mtu: Optional. The MTU of the physical network. The value must be between 1 and 9000.
##  - networkType: Optional. List of network type(s) that are allowed to be used on the specific
##  physical network. Value "vlan" is included by default, if not specified otherwise. The value
##  must be in list format. Possible values are: "flat", "vlan".
##  - vlanRange: Optional. The value must be in the following format: 'range_start:range_end'.
##  Non-consecutive ranges should be separated with a comma. The value must be in the following
##  format: 'range1_start:range1_end,range2_start:range2_end'. If specified, "vlan" must be
##  included as a networkType. Used e.g. by Neutron as range to pick VLAN IDs from.
##  - vniRange: Optional. The value must be in the following format: 'range_start:range_end'.
##  Non-consecutive ranges should be separated with a comma. The value must be in the following
##  format: 'range1_start:range1_end,range2_start:range2_end'. If specified, "vxlan" must be
##  included as a networkType. Used e.g. by Neutron as range vlan and vxlan both cannot be
##  present at the same time.
##  - trusted: Optional. The value must be "true" or "false".
##  When set to "true", all computes with passthrough devices in the physical network will be
##  able to host VMs with trusted Virtual Functions (VFs). Value "false" is used by default.
##
## Example configuration:
## physicalNetworks:
##   - name: PHY0
##     mtu: 2140
##     networkType:
##       - flat
##       - vlan
##     vlanRange: '100:150'
##     trusted: false
## ##To add vxlan range follow the below template
##   - name: PHY1
##     mtu: 2140
##     networkType:
##       - vxlan
##     vniRange: '1:1000'
