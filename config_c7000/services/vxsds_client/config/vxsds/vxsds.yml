## Under the vxsds.clusters compound key, vxsds service clusters are listed that can be
## accessed from the actual cee cluster. This information is then used to deploy VxSDS
## services in cee cluster. This information is also used for cinder-volume backend
## configuration for VxSDS.
##
## Attributes of the vxsds.clusters[]:
##
## - name: Name of the VxSDS cluster. This name is used as a reference, e.g. in cinder-
## volume plugin configuration for VxSDS, therefore its value must be unique.
## Mandatory.
## - ceeManaged: This element determines the management mode for VxSDS.
##   Possible values:
##   full   - Enables VxSDS in embedded mode to configure and deploy a VxSDS cluster
##            in a CEE cluster as storage back end.
##   client - Enables VxSDS in shared mode to connect a CEE cluster to an already
##            deployed external VxSDS cluster.
## Mandatory.
## - password: This element defines the password for the MDM admin user.
## Mandatory for embedded VxSDS, not applicable for shared VxSDS.
## - gatewayUser: the username used by cinder-volume on Gateway REST API to access
## VxSDS backend volumes. Must also be defined under the `users` key with
## `FrontEndConfigure` role.
## Mandatory.
## - gatewayAdminPassword: This element defines the password for the gateway admin user
## Mandatory for embedded VxSDS, not applicable for shared VxSDS.
## - gatewayIp: the GW IP address, on which gatewayUser access the VxSDS backends.
## Usually it is a VIP address.
## Mandatory for shared VxSDS, must be omitted for embedded VxSDS.
## - gatewayPort: the GW port number for gatewayIp address
## Mandatory for shared VxSDS, not applicable for embedded VxSDS.
## - gatewayBePorts:
## Mandatory for embedded VxSDS, not applicable for shared VxSDS.
##
##   Attributes of gatewayBePorts:
##
##   - ssl: ssl port
##   - http: http port
##
## - frontendNetworks: list of VxSDS frontend (sub)network names
## Mandatory for embedded VxSDS, not applicable for shared VxSDS.
## - backendNetworks: list of VxSDS backend (sub)network names
## Mandatory for embedded VxSDS, not applicable for shared VxSDS.
## - managementNetwork: list of VxSDS management (sub)network names
## Mandatory for embedded VxSDS, not applicable for shared VxSDS.
## - snmp: Please, see inline comments below in the example template.
## Optional for embedded VxSDS, not applicable for shared VxSDS.
## - users: This element lists the VxSDS user accounts
## Mandatory.
##
##   Attributes of users[]:
##
##   - name: user name
##   - pwd: user password
##   - role: Possible values:
##     Administrator || BackEndConfig || FrontEndConfigure || Monitor || Configure
##
## - protectionDomains: list of VxSDS protection domains.
## Mandatory.
##
##   Attributes of protectionDomains[]:
##
##   - name: Name of protection domain
##   - pools: list of pools for the protection domain
##
##     Attributes of pools[]:
##
##     - name: name of the pool
##     - zeroPadding: This element defines the zeropadding policy.
##     Possible values: ( enabled | disabled )
##     Default value is disabled.
##     Optional.
##     - sparePercentage: VxSDS reserves 10% of the capacity as spare (not allowing it
##     to be used for volume allocation) to ensure data protection during server
##     failures. The reserved spare capacity of each pool is recommended to be at least
##     equal to the amount of the capacity in the node containing the maximum capacity,
##     or the maximum Fault Set capacity.
##       If all nodes contain equal capacity, it is recommended to set the value of
##     sparePercentage to at least 1/N of the total. (N is the number of SDS nodes.)
##       For example, for three SDSs the sparePercentage must be 34 for each defined
##     pool to avoid the alarm about insufficient space reservation.
##     Default value is: 10.
##     Optional.
##     - mediatype: Storage pool configuration parameter.
##     Optional for embedded VxSDS, not applicable for shared VxSDS.
##       Possible values:
##       HDD - All devices in this storage pool will be HDDs.
##       SSD - All devices in this storage pool will be SSDs.
##       Default value of mediatype is SSD.
##     - volumeTypes: list of volume types that to be for the pool.
##     Currently not used, however it might change in the future, and will be used for
##     automated volume type creation.
##
##       Attributes of volumeTypes[]:
##
##       - name: name of the volume type
##       - provisioningType: Possible values: ( thin | thick )

  ## In the item below VxSDS client service should be configured.
  ## (this is reflected in `ceeManaged: client` setting)
  ##
  ## The VxSDS client service below should be configured to access a VxSDS server to be fully operational.
  ## This VxSDS server, in this case, will be deployed to a CEE cluster which is different from what
  ## the client will be deployed to. See description for configurationData for openstack and vxsds cluster
  ## in cluster.yaml for more information.
  ## The parameters of this VxSDS server should be given to the client below.
