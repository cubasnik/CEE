## subnets. Please note that dual stack is not supported, that is, either IPv4 or IPv6
## subnets have to be used. The IPv6 subnets in the template are based on that a
## fd01::0/64 subnet has been assigned to the organization. Please see the IP and VLAN
## plan for more info how to create IPv6 subnets out of an arbritary
## wwww:xxxx:yyyy:zzzz/64 subnet assigned to the organization.

    ## If VxSDS is used in CEE10, Frontend and Backend network(s) are needed.
    ## There are two recommended options for creating this.
    ##
    ## Option1: VxSDS support Path Diversity, so two separate networks can be created for Frontend (or/and
    ##          Backend) networks. These networks should be assigned to interfaces with different
    ##          sourceInterface (e.g. storage0 and storage1)
    ##          This is a common setup for setting VxSDS Frontend and Backend communication
    ##
    ## Option2: Create a network in which will bond (Split Plane) 2 vlan interfaces on 2 different
    ##          sourceInterface-s. This can be created for Frontend and/or Backend purposes as well
    ##
    ## Option1 and Option2 can be combined.
